# syfo-oppfolgingsplan-backend

## Local Development
- Build the project using `./gradlew build` to ensure all dependencies are resolved and the project is compiled.
- Run `docker compose up` to start the local postgres database, texas and mock-oauth2-server which is required for development.
- Run the application using `./gradlew run` to start the server locally.
- If you need an access token for testing secured endpoints you can run `./fetch-token-for-local-dev.sh` to get a fake token.
The auth server will always return a token with the claims defined in docker-compose.yml.

## Docker compose
### Size of container platform
In order to run kafka++ you will probably need to extend the default size of your container platform. (Rancher Desktop, Colima etc.)

Suggestion for Colima
```bash
colima start --arch aarch64 --memory 8 --cpu 4 
```

We have a docker-compose.yml file to run a postgresql database, texas and a fake authserver.
In addition, we have a docker-compose.kafka.yml that will run a kafka broker, schema registry and kafka-io

Start them both using
```bash
docker-compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.kafka.yml \
  up \
  db authserver texas broker kafka-ui \
  -d
```
Stop them all again
```bash
docker-compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.kafka.yml \
  down
```
You might also want to have access to the pdf generator locally.
You can clone the [repo](https://github.com/navikt/syfooppdfgen) and follow instructions in the README to spin it up using docker-compose

### Kafka-ui 
You can use [kafka-ui](http://localhost:9000) to inspect your consumers and topics. You can also publish or read messages on the topics

### Premade requests for testing
We have some [HTTP requests](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/http-client-in-product-code-editor.html) to help with 
running and testing the api. They are described [here](./src/test/http/README.md)

## Remote debug to app in nais-cluster
It is possible to add remote debug capabilities to apps running in the nais-cluster
A general description of how can be found in the 'utvikling' repo [here](https://github.com/navikt/utvikling/blob/main/docs/teknisk/Remote_debug_i_Intellij.md)

### Tweaks for the deployment
There are a few tweaks we need to do to the deployment manifest [nais-dev.yaml](./nais/nais-dev.yaml)

1. Add JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS to open up for remote debug. Add the follogin under ```env:``` 
```yaml
    - name: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS
      value: -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005
```
2. Tweak the liveness probe to be more forgiving before forcibly restarting the pod. Change ```periodSeconds``` and/or ```failureThreshold``` to give yourself enough time to debug. E.g.
```yaml
  liveness:
    path: /internal/is_alive
    initialDelay: 10
    timeout: 5
    periodSeconds: 60
    failureThreshold: 10 
```

Then run the following to create a tunnel from the deployment to your machine on the debug port 5005
```bash
kubectx dev-gcp
kubectl port-forward deployment/syfo-oppfolgingsplan-backend  -n team-esyfo 5005:5005
```
